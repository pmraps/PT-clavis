# en - Something other than what it appears to be. Stairsteps on what should be a smooth diagonal line are an example of spatial alias. Wagon wheels appearing to move backwards are an example of temporal alias. Aliases are cause by sampling and can be reduced or eliminated by pre-filtering, which can appear to be a blurring effect. Defects in the picture typically caused by insufficient sampling (violation of the Nyquist sampling rate) in the analog to digital conversion process or poor filtering of digital video. Defects are typically seen as jaggies on diagonal lines and twinkling or brightening in picture detail. Examples are: Temporal Aliasing — such as rotating wagon wheel spokes appearing to rotate in the reverse direction. Raster Scan Aliasing — such as sparkling or pulsing effects in sharp horizontal lines. Stair-Stepping — stepped or jagged edges in diagonal lines or the diagonal parts of a letter.
# pt - Algo diferente do que parece ser. As escadas no que deveria ser uma linha diagonal lisa são um exemplo de pseudónimo espacial. As rodas do vagão que parecem mover-se para trás são um exemplo de pseudónimo temporal. Os pseudónimos são causados por amostragem e podem ser reduzidos ou eliminados por pré-filtragem, o que pode parecer um efeito de embaçamento. Defeitos na imagem causados tipicamente por amostragem insuficiente (violação da taxa de amostragem Nyquist) no processo de conversão analógica para digital ou má filtragem do vídeo digital. Os defeitos são tipicamente vistos como jaggies nas linhas diagonais e cintilação ou brilho nos detalhes da imagem. Exemplos disso são: Aliasing temporal - tais como raios de roda de vagão rotativos que parecem rodar na direcção inversa. Aliasing Raster Scan - tais como efeitos cintilantes ou pulsantes em linhas horizontais afiadas. Stair-Stepping - margens escalonadas ou irregulares em linhas diagonais ou nas partes diagonais de uma letra.
